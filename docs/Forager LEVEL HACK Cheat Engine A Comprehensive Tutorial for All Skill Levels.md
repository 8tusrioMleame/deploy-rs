Forager is a 2D open world game where you can explore, craft, gather and manage resources, find secrets and build your base.

In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine, a popular tool for modifying games, to hack your level in Forager and gain access to more skills and items.
 
Cheat Engine is a free software that allows you to scan and change the values of variables in a running process, such as a game. You can download it from [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/).

## 5. Unlock the Magic and Industry Skills Early On
 
Every time you level up, you get a skill point that you can spend on unlocking new abilities and recipes. There are four skill trees to choose from: Foraging, Economy, Industry, and Magic. While you can eventually unlock them all, some skills are more useful than others at the beginning of the game.
 
One of the most important skills to get early on is Magic, which unlocks the Inscription Table. This allows you to craft scrolls that can have various effects, such as spawning resources, enemies, or items. The most useful scroll for leveling up is the Sage Scroll, which grants you a huge amount of XP when used. You can craft it with paper and lavender, both of which are easy to obtain.

Another skill tree that you should focus on is Industry, which unlocks various structures that can automate your production and resource gathering. For example, the Mining Rod can mine resources in a large area around it, saving you time and energy. The Factory can craft items faster and more efficiently than the Forge. The Power Plant can boost the speed and output of nearby structures.
 
## 6. Build Bridges to Access More Resources
 
As you explore the map, you will notice that some islands are separated by water or gaps that you cannot cross. However, you don't have to wait until you buy those islands to access their resources. You can simply build bridges over the water or gaps using wood or stone.
 
Bridges are cheap and easy to make, and they can help you reach more resources, items, puzzles, and secrets that are otherwise inaccessible. You can also use bridges to create platforms for placing structures or traps on water.
 
## 7. Use Bombs to Mine Faster
 
Mining is one of the main activities in Forager, but it can also be tedious and time-consuming. If you want to speed up the process and save some energy, you can use bombs to blast away large chunks of rocks and ores at once.
 
Bombs can be crafted at the Forge once you unlock the Ballistics skill. They require coal, iron ingots, and steel, which are fairly common materials. You can also find bombs as loot from enemies or chests, or buy them from shops. To use a bomb, simply place it near the rocks or ores you want to mine and wait for it to explode. Be careful not to stand too close, though, as bombs can damage you as well.
 
## 8. Sell Excess Items for Coins
 
Coins are the main currency in Forager, and you will need a lot of them to buy new lands and expand your territory. There are several ways to earn coins in the game, such as completing quests, finding treasure chests, or crafting coins at the Forge.
 
However, one of the easiest and fastest ways to make money is to sell excess items that you don't need or use. You can do this by building a Market structure, which allows you to sell items for a fraction of their value. You can also buy items from the Market at a higher price, but this is usually not worth it unless you really need something specific.
 
The Market will randomly offer different items for sale or purchase every few minutes, so check back often to see what's available. Some items are more valuable than others, so try to sell things that have a high value-to-weight ratio, such as gems, scrolls, artifacts, or rare materials.

## What Does Cytomic The Glue Do?
 
Cytomic The Glue is a compressor plug-in that can be used on individual tracks, groups, or the master buss. It has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, release, makeup gain, and mix parameters. It also has a sidechain filter, a range control, and a peak clipper option.
 
Cytomic The Glue works by applying a smooth and transparent compression to your audio signal, reducing the dynamic range and bringing out the loudness and energy of your mix. It also adds some subtle harmonic distortion and saturation that gives your sound a warm and analog character. Cytomic The Glue can help you achieve a cohesive and balanced mix that sounds professional and polished.

## How Does Cytomic The Glue Work?
 
Cytomic The Glue is based on the same high quality algorithms used in circuit simulators, but optimized for real time use. It uses an advanced peak detection method that responds accurately to fast transients and preserves the natural dynamics of your audio. It also has a soft knee feature that smooths out the compression curve and avoids harsh artifacts.
 
Cytomic The Glue has a unique range control that lets you limit the amount of compression applied to your signal. This allows you to retain some of the original dynamics and avoid over-compression. You can also use the mix control to blend the compressed and uncompressed signals for parallel compression effects.
 
Cytomic The Glue also has a built-in peak clipper that can be used to limit the output level and prevent clipping. This can add some extra punch and loudness to your mix without sacrificing quality. You can also use the sidechain filter to adjust the frequency response of the compressor's detector circuit. This can help you fine-tune the compression behavior and avoid unwanted pumping or ducking effects.
 
## How to Use Cytomic The Glue?
 
Cytomic The Glue is a versatile plug-in that can be used for various purposes. Here are some tips on how to use it effectively:
 
- Use Cytomic The Glue on your drum buss to add punch and glue to your drums. Set a low threshold, a high ratio, a fast attack, and a medium release. Adjust the makeup gain to match the input level. Use the range control to limit the amount of compression and preserve some of the drum dynamics.
- Use Cytomic The Glue on your vocal tracks to smooth out the vocal performance and enhance the clarity and presence of your vocals. Set a moderate threshold, a low ratio, a medium attack, and a fast release. Adjust the makeup gain to boost the vocal level. Use the sidechain filter to cut out some of the low frequencies from the detector circuit and avoid compressing too much of the vocal body.
- Use Cytomic The Glue on your master buss to add warmth and glue to your entire mix. Set a high threshold, a low ratio, a slow attack, and a fast release. Adjust the makeup gain to increase the perceived loudness of your mix. Use the mix control to blend in some of the dry signal for parallel compression effects.

Cytomic The Glue is an amazing compressor plug-in that can help you achieve professional sounding mixes with ease. It is compatible with VST, AU, AAX formats and works with most DAWs. You can buy it from [Cytomic's website](https://cytomic.com/product/glue/) for $99 or try it for free for 14 days.

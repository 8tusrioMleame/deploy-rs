# How to Download and Install FIFA 09 on PC
 
FIFA 09 is a popular soccer game released by Electronic Arts in 2008. It features realistic graphics, gameplay, and physics, as well as various modes and teams to choose from. If you want to play FIFA 09 on your PC, you will need to download a RAR file that contains the game files and a crack to bypass the copy protection. Here are the steps to download and install FIFA 09 on PC:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://archive.org/details/fifa-09_202109) and click on the "Download Options" button. Choose the "ZIP" option and wait for the download to finish.
2. Extract the ZIP file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named "FIFA 09" that contains an ISO file and a folder named "Crack".
3. Mount the ISO file using a program like Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive. You will see a virtual drive appear in your computer.
4. Open the virtual drive and run the "setup.exe" file. Follow the instructions to install FIFA 09 on your PC.
5. Copy the contents of the "Crack" folder and paste them into the installation directory of FIFA 09. This will replace the original files with cracked ones.
6. Run the "fifa09.exe" file from the installation directory to launch FIFA 09. Enjoy playing!

Note: You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall before running the crack, as some programs may detect it as a virus or malware. This is a false positive and you can safely ignore it.

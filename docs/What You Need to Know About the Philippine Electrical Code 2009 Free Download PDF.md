`  `
## What is Vorpx and How Does It Work?
`  `
Vorpx is a software that injects VR code into non-VR games, allowing you to play them in VR mode on your headset. It works by creating a virtual screen in front of your eyes, where the game is projected. You can adjust the size, position, and curvature of the screen to suit your preferences. You can also enable 3D mode, which creates a stereoscopic effect by rendering two slightly different images for each eye.
`  `
Vorpx also supports head tracking, which means that you can look around in the game world by moving your head. However, this does not mean that you can move around freely or interact with objects using your hands. You still need to use a keyboard, mouse, or controller to control your character and perform actions.

Vorpx claims to support hundreds of games, ranging from old classics to new releases. However, not all games work equally well with Vorpx. Some games may require extensive tweaking and configuration to run smoothly and look good in VR. Some games may not work at all or have serious issues such as glitches, crashes, or nausea.

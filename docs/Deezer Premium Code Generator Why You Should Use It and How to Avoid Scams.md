Deezer is a popular music streaming service that offers millions of songs, podcasts, and radio stations. Deezer also has a premium subscription that gives you access to higher quality audio, offline mode, no ads, and unlimited skips. But what if you want to enjoy Deezer premium without paying a monthly fee? Here are some ways to get Deezer premium for free in 2023.
 
## Method 1: Use a Free 6 Month Premium Code
 
One of the easiest ways to get Deezer premium for free is to use a free 6 month premium code that someone else has shared online. For example, a Reddit user posted a code that he got for purchasing a sound bar and didn't need it because he used Spotify. You can try to use his code or look for other codes on Reddit or other forums. However, keep in mind that these codes may not work for existing premium users or may have already been redeemed by someone else.

## Method 2: Use an App Cloner and a Temp Email
 
Another way to get Deezer premium for free is to use an app cloner and a temp email. This method exploits the 15 days free premium trial that Deezer offers on Android devices. The idea is to change your Android ID and create a new email address every time the trial expires, so that Deezer thinks you are a new user. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download an app cloner from [a2zapk.com](https://a2zapk.com). This is an app that lets you create multiple copies of the same app with different settings.
2. Download a temp email from [a2zapk.com](https://a2zapk.com). This is an app that lets you generate random email addresses that you can use for signing up for services.
3. Open the app cloner and clone the Deezer app. In the privacy settings of the cloned app, enable the Android ID changer option. This will randomize your Android ID and fool Deezer into thinking you are using a new device.
4. Open the temp email app and copy one of the email addresses. You can also check for any responses from Deezer without needing a password.
5. Open the cloned Deezer app and sign up for a new account using the temp email address. You will get a 15 days free premium trial.
6. Enjoy your free premium music until the trial runs out.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 every time you want to renew your free trial.

## Method 3: Use a Promo Code Generator
 
A third way to get Deezer premium for free is to use a promo code generator. This is a tool that generates random codes that you can use to redeem for premium subscriptions on Deezer. However, this method is not very reliable because most of the codes may not work or may have already been used by someone else. You can try to find a promo code generator online or use one of these links:

## Conclusion
 
These are some of the ways to get Deezer premium for free in 2023. However, none of these methods are guaranteed to work or are legal. You may risk losing your account or violating Deezer's terms of service by using them. The best way to enjoy Deezer premium is to pay for it and support the artists and creators who make the music you love.
